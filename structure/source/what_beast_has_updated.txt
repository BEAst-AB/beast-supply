This documentation shows what is changed in the "beastification" process to apply BEAst comments on 
messages and BIS documentation.

Principles for how changes are made:
1. The BIS documents are managed like this:
	- We create a new file as a copy of an existing one when we want to edit the text in the file.
	  Name of the new file is "beast_" + the old filename. Example: Old name "shipment.adoc" becomes "beast_shipment.adoc"
	- In files named "index.adoc" we need to replace the old filenames with the beast filenames to include the BEAst versions instead of the standard versions.
	  Example: "include::shipment.adoc[]" is replaced by "include::beast_shipment.adoc[]"
	- We never edit an existing file except the index files. 

2. The message documentations are managed like this:
	Basically the documentation is retrieved from the Peppol standard documentation.
	In some cases BEAst want to add more information, and that is done by adding lines with the command
	"<?DescriptionAddFirst xxxxx ?>" or variants of it, like "<?schemeID-DescriptionAddFirst xxxxx ?>"





In this version (4.0.2) the following changes are made:
