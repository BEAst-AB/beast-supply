== Logistics information

The Logistics elements can be used to specify different pack levels for the same item:

* Each pack level is regarded as a unique item and must be sent as a separate Catalogue line and identified with a unique identification such as GTIN.
* Information about pack level is done in the element PackLevelCode on line level.
The Pack level codes are based on the Edifact/Eancom-standard and the following codes are available:
** DU = Dispatch Unit
** HN = Handling Unit (level between TU and DU).
** TU = Traded Unit
** CU = Consumer Unit
* It should be stated if the pack level is orderable.
* The relation between pack levels should be specified by using Component Related Item, e.g. that a Dispatch unit contains Traded units.
For the higher level Packed Quantity should be used.
