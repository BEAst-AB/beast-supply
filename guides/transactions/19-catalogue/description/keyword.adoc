[[keyword]]
== Keyword

Keywords are sent to let the Buyer search for an item without knowing the item identification or name.
Keywords tag can be repeated (0..n), but the number should be limited to ensure correct handling in the receiving system.

It is also possible to send several keywords in the same tag, by using a separator between the different keywords.
Which separator that should be used, must be agreed between the parties.
Example of a separator can be the %-sign, as this is not used anywhere else.
