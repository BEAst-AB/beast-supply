= Business rules

As previously stated, this {peppol} BIS is based on {bii3} Profile 35 - Advanced Tendering with pre-award catalogue, and extended with specific requirements and rules to ensure necessary information that is needed in the link:https://peppol.eu/downloads/?rel=tab87[PEPPOL Transport infrastructure]

Rules to ensure the basic structure of the xml (mandatory elements/attributes, fixed values etc) has been auto-generated in this project, and hence any identical rules from {bii3} has been depricated.

A list of all rules for this transaction is found here:  https://test-vefa.difi.no/peppolbis/pracc/catalogue/1.0/rules[PreAward Catalogue rules] and in the https://test-vefa.difi.no/peppolbis/pracc/catalogue/1.0/syntax/catalogue/tree[syntax mapping] rules valid for specific elements or attributes are listed.
