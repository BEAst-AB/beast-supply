= Scope

The intended scope for this {peppol} BIS includes business-to-government (B2G)
relationships. Although the BIS is a basis for an EDI agreement between two parties, it does not address all
business level details of such an agreement/contract.

The Pre-award Catalogue request is intended to be used in different tendering processes in the context of P002 - Procurement Document Access.
