= Scope

The intended scope for this {peppol} BIS includes business-to-government (B2G) and business-to-business 
relationships. Although the BIS is a basis for an EDI agreement between two parties, it does not address all
business level details of such an agreement/contract.

The Pre-award Catalogue request is intended to be used in different tendering processes in the context of P002 - Procurement Document Access when 
used in B2G situations and in B2B situations like this: 

1.  Establishing a Framework Agreement as a base for future business between companies. 

2.  Request For Quote (RFQ) based on, or without, a Framework Agreement to agree on prices and terms.
