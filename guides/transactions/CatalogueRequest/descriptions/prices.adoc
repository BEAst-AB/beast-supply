= Prices

Prices are normally not a part of the pre-award Catalogue Request transaction. But in some situations, like when a maximum price needs to be 
communicated, they can be used. Use the PriceTypeCode to define what type of price you mean. 

Be aware that no Gross prices can be sent in the format (price before discount and charges). All prices shall have Currency as an attribute. 
Currency shall be according to Code list.
