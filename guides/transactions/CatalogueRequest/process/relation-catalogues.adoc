Pre-award catalogue will be created based on requirements from the tendering documents or from the notification. Pre-award catalogues can be used in all procedures. In this description the input to the pre-award catalogue is based on a pre-award catalogue request. Pre-award catalogue request is the tool for the contracting authority (CA) to structure requirements for goods, services and works. The pre-award catalogue request contains a generic description of the needs to the CA. Based on the generic descriptions and requirements the economic operator (EO) create pre-award catalogue based on their own assortment of goods, services or works to fulfill the requirement of the CA.

Example of generic description can be classifications systems such as UNSPSC, CPV or eCl@ss. Examples of generic requirements are code lists for environment, social and ecological labels or labels that is equivalent. It can be certification/ attestation of certain skills as surgical nurse, midwife, different kinds of engineers or other speciality of occupation.
Contraction authority has stored the generic description and requirements from the pre-award catalogue request in the tendering system, and can undertake an automated evaluation of the different offers from different EO´s with the pre-award catalogue as a structured and standardized input.

After the evaluation process the pre-award catalogue will be stored and after signing the contract with EO transferred to the eProcurement system (catalogue tool) to be used as baseline. The purpose is to check the electronic product catalogue toward the contract when or if the EOs can update the catalogue.

Using catalogues in the tendering process will save processing time both for EO´s and CA´s and will enhance transparency and traceability of goods, services and works. To achieve good and effective processes the EO should have their own eSubmission systems based on a 4-corner model to be able to communicate with different tendering platforms based on standard formats and PEPPOL branches of CEF eDelivery.
