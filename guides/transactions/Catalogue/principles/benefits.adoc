PEPPOL BIS pre-award catalogue will stimulate the service provider marked to develop services that covers tendering processes both for contracting authorities and economic operators. Pre-award catalogue together with tendering metadata transaction (trdm090) and confirmation message (trdm045) will:

* make it possible for the CA to evaluate products and services automatically through their tendering tools
* make it easier for the economic operators to participate in different tendering processes
* save time for the EO to offer their products and services to a CA when the list of products and services are standardized
* save time for the CA to have a standardized list of products and services
*	make it possible for economic operators to use tools to pre-fill their information before the specific tender and send the offer in a structured way through CEF eDelivery (PEPPOL) infrastructure. The benefit is that an EO uses one tool in different tenders instead of dealing with different interfaces depending on which tool the CA uses.
* make it possible for the CA to use the pre-award catalogue in mini-competitions and re-opening of competitions
* make it possible for an EO to use the PEPPOL BIS pre-award catalogue xml when up-loading the tender in a 3-corner model on condition that tendering systems are compatible.
