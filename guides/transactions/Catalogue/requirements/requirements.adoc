= Pre-award Catalogue transaction business requirements

The table below gives an overview of the transaction business requirements for the pre-award catalogue. The requirements are derived from the {bii3} project on pre-award Catalogue, as well as the catalogue work from TC440.

Please note that several of the requirements refer to the order. This is due to the fact that the pre-award catalogue has been aligned with the post-award catalogue, to make it easier to move from a pre- to a post award catalogue after the contract is signed.


.General business requirements
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|====
|Id
|Requirement

|op-t68-001
|The specification on the requested kind of goods and/or services shall be provided in a structured description.

|op-t68-002
|A pre-award catalogue shall contain the procurement reference number of the call for tenders.

|op-t68-003
|The transaction shall contain all information necessary for its application i.e. it shall not rely on the availability of external references such as a centralised repository of item information. No external data sources should be needed in order to ease the processing of a pre-award catalogue request.

|op-t68-004
|It shall be reusable in post-award processes, i.e., a pre-award catalogue shall have information that makes it possible to use as a post-award catalogue, even if some information might be added later in the process. There is a potential difference between the pre-award and the post-award catalogue when it comes to the extent of required information. A "principle of proportionality" means that the information that can be required in relation to a tender and a pre-award catalogue must be in proportion to the offered contract. In a post-award catalogue, after the parties have signed an agreement, more information can be requested by the buyer to describe the products in more details.

.Item requirements
[cols="1,4", options="header"]
|====
|Id
|Requirement

|op-t68-040
|An item is a specification within a catalogue line of an offer of a product by the economic operator

|op-t68-041
|An item in a pre-award catalogue shall be uniquely identifiable by a name and an identifier, to ensure that the item can be referenced, e.g., by an id.

|op-t68-042
|An item may have a description.

|op-t68-043
|To align with post award catalogue, it shall be possible to specify how an item can be ordered. This includes amongst others allowed units of measure, order sizes, minimal and maximal order sizes. There might exist restrictions from the production process or a need to simplify or limit the costs of the ordering and logistics process, so that the order size is restricted. Thus, the buyer needs information to place a correct order that is not denied by the supplier.

|op-t68-044
|It shall be possible to specify how the items will be packaged.

|op-t68-045
|It shall be possible to specify logistic conditions and other needed service information on how the item will be delivered. This includes information on maximum and minimum storage temperature, information needed for cross-border logistics processes. To define the products to be done for each package unit along the supply chain.

|op-t68-046
|It shall be possible to specify how the item is priced. This includes factors that have influence on the price as well as relationships to other parts of the catalogue that may have impact on the price. The price can be dependent on many factors, e.g., delivery region (down to the city level), allowance, charges, currency, etc.

|op-t68-047
|It should be possible to specify the period of time an item price is valid. If no validity period is specified, the price is valid until cancelled. The same as in tbr19-003, but on the item level. This allows to have items with different validity periods in the same catalogue. This does not mean, that the item will expire.

|op-t68-048
|Prices shall not be negative.

|op-t68-049
|It shall be possible to provide information that helps to search for the item, e.g., keywords or item description used in a full text search.

|An item shall include information that allow to compare the item with other items.

|op-t68-055
|It should be possible to provide information on the product marking, e.g., to indicate that environmental or social requirements on the item production were followed. Procurement managers need information about environmental marking applicable for a given item in order to ensure that environmental, ecological, food safety and basic human rights aspects were respected. On the other side, sales managers wish to provide this kind of information, e.g., for marketing purposes.

|op-t68-056
|It should be possible to specify the manufacturer of the item. In particular, for the case where the supplier is different from the manufacturer of the item.

|op-t68-057
|It should be possible to specify hazard indicators for an item by any indicator system. If an item can be a danger to people or the environment, so called hazardous goods, often legal requirements demand that such items have indicators to indicate the danger that come from this item. Furthermore, such items require special handling in the logistics process

|op-t68-058
|It shall be possible to specify the semantic relationships with cardinalities between different items in the pre-award catalogue request. In particular, it shall be possible to specify part-of relationships, to specify that not only an item is tendered, but also additional items belonging to it. E.g., items that are accessories for other items or are replacements for defect components of an item. This helps to specify for instance that not only printers are tendered, but also print cartridges.

|op-t68-059
|It should be possible to specify a delivery location on line level, with address, city, post code, etc., so that all details on each line are dependent on this location, including price, tax and other specifications. Needed to support the buying decision, to see how much has to be paid in the end.
