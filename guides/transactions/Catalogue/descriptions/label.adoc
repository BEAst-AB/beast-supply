= Labels and Requirements

The party requesting the pre-award catalogue may have requirements related to the environment, ecologically produced food, fair trade and many more. 
They may also demand that basic human rights are respected in the product production and trade. To be able to highlight products that meet some of 
these criteria, the PEPPOL BIS pre-award catalogue contains elements to document Environmental labelling and Social certificates as well as proof 
for other requirements. The labels are connected to the relevant product or service on line level enabling the buyer to evaluate them in the tendering 
tool. Detailed information about the different labels can be found on the issuing partyâ€™s web-site which is referred to via an URI.

Introducing these classification codes in pre-award catalogue will support the aim for sustainable procurement, and make it possible to measure the 
purchasing behaviour and monitor that the requirements from the tendering process are fulfilled.

Furthermore, the party requesting the pre-award catalogue may also have requirements regarding register enrollment, quality assurance standards or 
other relevant factors. These requirements may be met by the economic operator through certificates, self-declarations or other means of proof.

For this matter, eCertis may be used to specify both requirements and their means of proof. A guide to eCertis can be found here:
