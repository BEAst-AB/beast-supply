= Labels and Requirements

Public actors will have requirements related to the environment, ecologically produced food, fair trade and many more. They may also demand that basic human rights are respected in the product production and trade. To be able to highlight products that meet some of these criteria, the PEPPOL BIS pre-award catalogue contains elements to document Environmental labelling and Social certificates as well as proof for other requirements. The labels are connected to the relevant product or service on line level enabling the buyer to evaluate them in the tendering tool. Detailed information about the different labels can be found on the issuing party’s web-site which is referred to via an URI.

In post-awards process, when the buyer use the search engines in their eProcurement system to purchase the products and services, the labels will be visible and the buyer has the possibility to choose products that is marked with a label. The post-award catalogue has the same structure so it´s important to reuse the information used in pre-award catalogue.
Several labels can be connected to each product. As part of the identification the code list is provided so the service provider can define and implement the information in the system.

The following can be used: link:https://vefa.difi.no/ehf/codelist/eco/[]

Introducing these classification codes in pre-award catalogue will support the aim for sustainable procurement, and make it possible to measure the purchasing behaviour and monitor that the requirements from the tendering process are fulfilled.

Furthermore, public actors may also have requirements regarding register enrollment, quality assurance standards or other relevant factors. These requirements may be met by the economic operator through certificates, self-declarations or other means of proof.

For this matter, eCertis may be used to specify both requirements and their means of proof. A guide to eCertis can be found here: link:https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/assets/eCertisQuickGuidePublic_en.pdf[]
