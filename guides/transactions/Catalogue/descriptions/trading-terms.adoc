= Trading terms

If there is no previous contract to refer to, or if something needs to be different from the referred contract, any type of Trading terms can be 
specified. The type of term is set in `cbc:Reference` and the term itself will be found in `cbc:Information`. When more than one item is needed for the 
term, split the parts with “#” as in the example.
