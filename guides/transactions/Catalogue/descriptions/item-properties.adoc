= Additional Item Properties

Additional properties are meant for product properties that cannot be sent in any of the defined elements in the Pre-Award Catalogue. Additional 
properties consist of the Name, NameCode and/or Identity of the property and the actual Value.


.Example of additional properties:
* Color
* Nutrition +
Stated with amount per 100 g/ml.
* Genetically modified +
Legal values: True, False
* Climate Impact of the product can be sent as a property. 
See usecase example. 

The property can be identified by a NameCode that must be known by both sender and receiver, but better is to identify the property with an ID that 
is defined in a standard public Data Dictionary (DD) and to provide the attributes where to find the DD. 
Therefore it is recommended to use Property identification from standardised Data Dictionaries.
