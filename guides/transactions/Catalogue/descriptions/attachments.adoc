= Attachments

Attachments can be sent on line level in the Catalogue. This can be images or additional descriptions of a product. It is strongly recommended to use external references in the form of URIâ€™s for attachments.

If binary objects are attached to the PreAward Catalogue, the valid values for mimetype can be found in section <<Mime code of attached document>>
