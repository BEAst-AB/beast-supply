containing the consignment.

Serial shipping container code (SSCC) issued by GS1 may be used to identify the transport handling unit.
Note that the same physical handling unit may contain items from different despatch lines.
Implemented by referencing the same SSCC code in the ID element of the TransportHandlingUnit on several despatch lines.
