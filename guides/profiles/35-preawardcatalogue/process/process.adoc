The PEPPOL BIS Pre-Award Catalogue is most normally used in P003 - Tender Submission.

The pre-award catalogue transaction can also be used in other choreographies as qualification, DPS, mini competition and re-opening of competition (post-award phase).

The use of the pre-award catalogue in these other choreographies are not explained in detail in this document.
