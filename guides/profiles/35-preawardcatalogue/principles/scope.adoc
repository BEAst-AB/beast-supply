= Scope

The intended scope for this {peppol} BIS includes business-to-government (B2G) and business-to-business (B2B)
relationships. Although the BIS is a basis for an EDI agreement between two parties, it does not address all
business level details of such an agreement/contract.

The Pre-award Catalogue is intended to be used in different tendering processes, such as:

. Tendering (P003 - Tender Submission)
. DPS solutions, qualifications etc
** These processes are not described in detail in this document, but the transaction can be used in these processes if bilaterally agreed.
