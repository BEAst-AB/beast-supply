= Classification

An item may be classified according to UNSPSC being the mandatory public classification schemes in some countries/sectors.
As there is currently no code for UNSPSC in the used code list UNCL 7143, the code "MP" (Product/service identification number) is used.
Products can also be classified according to regulatory schemes or classification schemes used in certain business sectors.
