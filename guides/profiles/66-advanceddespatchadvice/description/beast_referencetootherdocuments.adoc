The two different types of Weight Statements (DocumentTypeCode "14" and "15") should be used like this:
Use "14" when you as the supplier has sold the material (See use-case 7.).
Use "15" when you as the supplier has not sold the material but is only referring to the Weight Statement (See use-case 6 and 10.).
