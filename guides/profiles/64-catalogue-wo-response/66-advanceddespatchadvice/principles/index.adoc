== Despatch Advice message in general

The electronic transaction described in this implementation guide is the Despatch Advice message. The Despatch Advice message is used in the fulfillment process by the supplier to notify the receiver about, the despatch and delivery period for the goods or services being delivered, as well as details about the agreed delivery for cross checking with the order and ultimately the Electronic Despatch Advice is used for detailing the delivery. 

The main activities supported by this message are:

* *Transport* Full description of how the goods is packed and delivered, or how and when the services are delivered. A delivery is taken to be a number of items that are despatched as a single consignment to a single delivery address.
* *Ordering* States what is shipped or delivered; the quantity of the delivery and what is outstanding.
* *Receiving* Full support of the process of receiving goods into a warehouse, inventory, in stores or simply at a reception counter or receiving services at agreed location.
