This chapter describes the principles and assumptions that underlie the use of PEPPOL Pre-Award Catalogue. The B2G (Business To Government) part is
based on P003 - Tender Submission. The B2B (business To Business) part is limited to include only RFQ (Request For Quote) and Quote.

This BIS will identify, explain and justify the business requirements for the Pre-award Catalogue. It
provides syntax bindings to OASIS UBL 2.1. It also includes a syntax implementation guide.
