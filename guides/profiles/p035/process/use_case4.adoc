== Use case 4 from B2B (Business To Business)

This UseCase describes a situation where the RFQ and Quote have a mix of lines with Rented and Purchased products.  
There also is a mix of lines where the Item Number is known in most cases but defined by a set of Properties in one case, requesting the Supplier 
to select the best alternative. 

For lines covering Rented products, two quantities are needed. The number of Items and the number of Days to rent it. The main quantity is the Rental 
Period, and it is sent in cbc:MinimumQuantity and cbc:MaximumQuantity. If the price is for a quantity of more than one of the rented item, that quantity 
should be sent in cbc:ContentUnitQuantity. 

Since no Framework Agreement exists, terms are included in the Quote.
