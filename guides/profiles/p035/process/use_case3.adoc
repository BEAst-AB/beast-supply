== Use case 3 from B2B (Business To Business)

RFQ and Quote exchanged between two companies to agree on prices and terms for a specific Project when no previous Framework Agreement is in place. 
The Delivery Address and the Delivery Period for the Project is sent in the RFQ and the products are known and identified by GTIN numbers.  

The prices in the returned Quote are stacked and depend on the actual quantity ordered. Since no Framework Agreement exists, terms are included in the 
Quote. 

Price for the Transportation to the Delivery Address is added as a separate line in the Quote that is not referring to any line in the RFQ. 
When receiving the Quotes from the Suppliers they can easily be compared to select the best offer.
