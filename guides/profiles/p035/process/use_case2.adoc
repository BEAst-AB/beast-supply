= Use case 2 from B2B (Business To Business)

RFQ and Quote exchanged between two companies in the Construction area to agree on prices and terms to buy Material for a specific project when a 
Framework Agreement is already in place. The products are based on wood. 
The Buyer can send the RFQ to more than one Supplier. The only difference in the RFQ would then be the ReceiverParty and the referenced Contract. 
The Buyer specifies in the RFQ the products using Classification and Properties. No item numbers are given in the request in this example. 
The Supplier then identifies the product with an identity (SellersItemIdentification) in the Quote, and also returns the values of the requested 
Properties. 

When receiving the Quotes from the Suppliers they can easily be compared to select the best offer.
