== Use case 5 from B2B (Business To Business)

This UseCase shows how the Pre-award Catalogue can be used for more complex and configured products, in this case Windows. 

The RFQ describes the Windows required by a set of properties in combination with a reference to a drawing. The BuyersItemIdentification gives a 
reference to the window in the Drawing. The Quote contains the Seller’s Item Identification on the windows selected to match the requirements. 

Since no Framework Agreement exists, terms are included in the Quote.
