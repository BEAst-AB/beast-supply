= Introduction to openPEPPOL and BIS

This {peppol} BIS provides a set of specifications for implementing a {peppol} business process. 
The document is concerned with clarifying requirements for ensuring interoperability of both pan-European Public eProcurement and eProcurement 
between companies and provides guidelines for the support and implementation of these requirements. 
The {bii3} Profile “BII Profile 35 Advanced Tendering” is the basis for this work for the Public eProcurement part. The eProcurement between companies
also includes processes for Qualifying suppliers (RFI - Request For Information) and Suggesting solutions (RFP - Request For Proposal), but in this 
document we focus on the Quotation process (RFQ - Request For Quote and Quote) since companies will start by implementing this part of eProcurement.
The Pre-award Catalogue Request is used as the RFQ - Request For Quote and the Pre-award Catalogue is used as the Quote.
